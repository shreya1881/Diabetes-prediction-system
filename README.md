# Diabetes-prediction-system

This is a Data Scienc eand Machine learning based project.

This project aims towards building a predictive system for diabetes where '0' represents that the person is not diabetic and '1' represents that the person is diabetic.
The model is trained on features taken from the dataset. Some of the features inlcude person's age, insulin etc.
The model is trained and built using Support vector machine algorithm of machine learning.
